# Homebrew Tap

A homebrew tap for my personal projects.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install chaychoong/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap chaychoong/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "chaychoong/tap"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Formulae
